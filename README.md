# FusionSolarPy

A very basic python client for the HuaweiFusionSolar API used to monitor
solar power plants.

This client uses the https://region01eu5.fusionsolar.huawei.com end point by default. It is
possible to change this using the `huawei_subdomain` parameter. But this has not
been tested on any other end-points.

Please report any bugs!

## Installation

Simply install from pypi using:

```bash
pip install fusion_solar_py
```

## Usage

The basic usage centers around the `FusionSolarClient` class. It currently
only has one method to extract the current power production, the total
power production for the current day, and the total energy ever produced
by the plant.

```python
from fusion_solar_py.client import FusionSolarClient

# log into the API - with proper credentials...
client = FusionSolarClient("my_user", "my_password")

# NOTE: Depending on your region, you may need to set the
# `huawei_subdomain` parameter. This is the first part of the
# URL when you enter the FusionSolar API through your webbrowser
#
# client = FusionSolarClient("my_user", "my_password", huawei_subdomain="region01eu5")

# get the stats
stats = client.get_power_status()

# print all stats
print(f"Current power: {stats.current_power_kw} kW")
print(f"Total power today: {stats.energy_today_kwh} kWh")
print(f"Total power: {stats.energy_kwh} kWh")

# log out - just in case
client.log_out()
```

It is additional possible to retrieve the data for specific
plants - in case multiple plants are available through the
account.

```python
from fusion_solar_py.client import FusionSolarClient

# log into the API - with proper credentials...
client = FusionSolarClient("my_user", "my_password")

# get the plant ids
plant_ids = client.get_plant_ids()

print(f"Found {len(plant_ids)} plants")

# get the data for the first plant
plant_data = client.get_plant_stats(plant_ids[0])

# plant_data is a dict that contains the complete
# usage statistics of the current day. There is
# a helper function available to extract some
# most recent measurements
last_values = client.get_last_plant_data(plant_data)

print(f"Last production at {last_values['productPower']['time']}: {last_values['productPower']['value']}")

# In case you have a battery installed
print(f"Last battery charge at {last_values['chargePower']['time']}: {last_values['chargePower']['value']}")

# Additionally, if you have a meter installed you can get additional statistics
print(f"Total power consumption (today): {last_values['totalUsePower']} kWh")
print(f"Total produced power (today): {last_values['totalPower']} kWh")
print(f"Produced power consumed (today): {last_values['totalSelfUsePower']} kWh")
print(f"Relative amount of used power bought from grid: {last_values['buyPowerRatio']}%")

# print all optimizer stats
for x in client.get_optimizer_stats(client.get_device_ids()['Inverter']):
    print(f"{x['optName']}: {x['moStatus']} {x['runningStatus']}: {x['outputPower']} W /" +
          f" {x['inputVoltage']} V / {x['inputCurrent']} A / {x['temperature']} C")


# log out - just in case
client.log_out()
```

## Available plant data / stats

This is a list of variables and a (guessed) explanation of what they mean returnd from
`get_plant_stats` and as an abbreviated version by `get_last_plant_data`.

### Total values

These values are always the total (in kWh) for the current day:

  * **totalSelfUsePower**: Total kWh of the current day's production used.
  * **selfProvide**: Total kWh of the current day's production used (same as above).
  * **totalBuyPower**: Total kWh bought from the grid today.
  * **totalProductPower**: Total kWh produced by the PV today.
  * **totalUsePower**: Total kWh used today.
  * **totalOnGridPower**: Total kWh returned to the grid today.

### Ratios

Ratios are given in percent (f.e. "35.93" for a ratio of 0.3593)

  * **onGridPowerRatio**: Proportion of today's PV production returned to the grid.
  * **buyPowerRatio**: Proportion of power consumed today that was bought from the grid.
  * **selfUsePowerRatioByProduct**: Proportion of produced power used.

### Logicals

  * **existInverter**: (Boolean) Set if an inverter (ie a PV plant) is installed
  * **existCharge**: (Boolean) - Maybe true if currently charging.
  * **existMeter**: (Boolean) Set if a meter is installed.
  * **existEnergyStore**: (Boolean) - Maybe true if a storage is installed.
  * **existUsePower**: (Boolean) - Maybe true if the own power is used.

### Timecourses

These are returned as lists of values. The matching timepoints are found in the
`xAxis` list. `get_last_plant_data` returns these values as a dict with the key
`time` and `value` representing the last valid measurement (ie. not "--").

  * **selfUsePower**: Amount of energy produced by the PV used.
  * **dischargePower**: Amounf of energy discharged from the storage.
  * **chargePower**: Amount of energy charged into the storage.
  * **onGridPower**: (Probably) The amount of power returned to the grid.
  * **disGridPower**: (Probably) The amount of power taken from the grid.
  * **productPower**: Amounf of power produced by the PV.
  * **usePower**: Amount of power used.
